# SSH.net-WinSCP-Replacement

Work in progress to create a drop in replacement for the WinSCP .net wrapper based on SSH.net.

WinSCP provides some nice features, and a lot of code is already written for it - if there's a nuget library which literally allows a drop in replacement 
then that code can run on more platforms (Linux, macOS).

Built from nescessity, provided as courtesy.
